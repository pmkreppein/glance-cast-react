        <p>Welcome to Glancecast!  This is the start of a hobby project of mine to make weather info quicker to access.  This is also a portfolio project for the Flatiron Online Code Bootcamp
        that I am working on.  Right now, this websites includes <a href="https://darksky.net/">Darksky</a> data and <a href="https://www.weather.gov/forecastmaps">National Weather Service</a> 
        forecast maps.  Darksky offers a great API and the National Weather Service has troves of data all available for free!

        I intend to continue building this project out, so check back soon as updates are posted!  You can learn more about me <a href="https://pmkdev.com">here.</a>  Thanks for visiting!

        Below is a visual representation of the National Weather Service's daily nationwide forecasts.
